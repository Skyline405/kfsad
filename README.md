**WARNING** This repo is frozen to be in touch with original presentation. There is [a new repository under Kotlin](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-full-stack-application-demo) with actual Kotlin version and Kotlin/JS Gradle plugin.

# kotlin-full-stack-application-demo

A full-stack demo application written in Kotlin for [JetBrains Night Moscow 2019](https://info.jetbrains.com/jetbrains-night-moscow-2019).
Presentation [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsREyo6DlTg) in Russian.

## Description

This application displays a feed containing user-generated posts and comments. All data is stubbed by the fakeJSON and JSON Placeholder services.

It is a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html) project.

It uses:
- [kotlin-multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/770a2e3f2d337b84f72dd574d6564913e065b58d/libraries/tools/kotlin-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/org/jetbrains/kotlin/gradle/plugin/KotlinMultiplatformPlugin.kt) plugin for Kotlin compilation;
- [kotlin-frontend-plugin](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-frontend-plugin) for frontend configuration;
- [Ktor framework](https://ktor.io) as a web server;
- [H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) in-memory database with [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) to preload posts at application startup;
- [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) for client/server (de-)serialization and RPC;
- [React](https://reactjs.org), [Styled components](https://www.styled-components.com), [Ring UI 2.0](https://jetbrains.github.io/ring-ui/develop-2.0/index.html) and [kotlin-wrappers](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers) for rendering. 

During application startup posts are preloaded to the in-memory database from the fakeJSON (or JSON Placeholder) service. 
When the user requests the page, several posts are selected from the DB and the corresponding comments are fetched via the multi-platform HTTP client.
Posts with comments are served to the client via RPC. After the initial render is done, information about authors is fetched via the client-side HTTP client and rendered after all coroutines terminate successfully.
The "Load more comments" button fetches additional comments for the post using the multi-platform HTTP client.

This application has no error handling and has very limited RPC serialization. It's not meant for production use and serves only as a technology example.
